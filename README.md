# AgileCaseSurvey
•	Began research work term on April 20th 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Paul Ralph and Dr Klaas-Jan Stol.
	•	Coding Scheme (Coding Scheme.xlsx) was provided by Dr. Ralph. 
	•	Training was given by Dr. Paul to Arham on how to modify the coding scheme and develop a set develop a set of hypotheses. 
	•	Dr. Klaas gave us a set of papers which are now Primary Studies 98 in this list.
	•	Arham conducted informal keyword search to find new primary studies that meet the inclusion criteria in the coding scheme
	•	Arham found 27 new papers and added them in the ‘primary studies new’ directory (Now 98 + 27 = 125 papers).
	•	Arham began coding papers (averaging around 3-4 papers per day).
	•	Arham coded 20 random papers (Now Primary Studies 98 - 20 = 78)
	•	Coding scheme was reviewed in mid-May when majority of the papers did not report anything about Language Difference hence the column Language Diff was excluded from the coding scheme.
	•	Dr.Klass and Dr. Ralph reviewed the endogenous variables in the coding scheme and added two new columns: ‘Control Issues’ and ‘Cultural Issues’.
	•	Arham revised the 20 coded papers again and added data for the new columns in the coding scheme.
	•	Arham finished coding all the papers by the end of June.
	•	A questionnaire was designed and sent to all the authors in the primary studies that reported single cases.

•	We generated this coding scheme: link
•	Arham read/coded 20 random papers (Now Primary Studies 1-20) 
•	Paul, Arham and Klaas reviewed the coding scheme and made some changes: (summary of changes)
•	Next we did informal keyword search and found primary studies X-Y  
•	Arham coded all these papers
•	Next we did backward snowballing and found primary studies Y-Z
•	Forward snowballing found Z-A
•	Arham read all of the new papers, in this order, and coded them in this spreadsheet:
•	Meanwhile we made this survey: (PDF of survey)
•	etc. (I probably missed a dozen steps)
